# 🥇 First-Come-First-Serve-Algorithm

## Overview 📜

This project provides a C++ implementation of the First Come First Serve (FCFS) CPU scheduling algorithm. FCFS is one of the simplest scheduling algorithms used in operating systems. The program simulates the execution of processes based on their arrival time and burst time, calculating metrics such as completion time, waiting time, and turnaround time.

## Features 🌟

- 👥 **User-friendly interface** for inputting arrival time and burst time of processes.
- 🕒 **Sorting of processes** based on arrival time to implement FCFS.
- 📊 **Calculation of completion time, waiting time, and turnaround time** for each process.
- 🗂️ **Displaying results in a tabular format** for easy understanding.
- 🧮 **Calculation of average waiting time** for the set of processes.

## How to Use 🚀

1. ⚙️ **Compile the `FCFS.cpp` file** using a C++ compiler:
2. ▶️ **Run the compiled executable**:
3. ✍️ **Enter the number of processes** and input arrival time and burst time for each process as prompted.
4. 👀 **View the calculated metrics** and average waiting time displayed in the table.
